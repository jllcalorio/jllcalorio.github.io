In December of 2024, I participated and **won 2nd place** in the ["T.L. Saaty Global Hackathon 2024,"](https://www.creativedecisions.org/org_events/index.php?section=global24) where I presented my problem "What should an autonomous vehicle (AV) do when an ambulance behind it suddenly switches to emergency mode, activating its sirens, while both are stopped at a red light?" In this online event, I have applied my learnings (in my previous role) regarding Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), but now using Python. This event was hosted by the [Creative Decisions Foundation](https://www.creativedecisions.org/). See more [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/388361212_What_should_an_autonomous_vehicle_AV_do_when_an_ambulance_behind_it_suddenly_switches_to_emergency_mode_activating_its_sirens_while_both_are_stopped_at_a_red_light).

This year's hackathon centered on "Ethical Dilemmas and Responsibility in Autonomous Vehicles."" Participants from around the globe engaged in three days of interactive training and mentoring, which ended with two rounds of competition. Each participant designed problems and solved them using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) using the Benefits, Opportunities, Costs, and Risks (BOCR) framework through the AhpAnpLib package in Python.
