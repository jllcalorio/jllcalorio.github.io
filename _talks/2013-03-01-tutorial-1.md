The goal of this webinar was mainly to educate the students of the [Davao Medical School Foundation, Inc.](https://www.dmsf.edu.ph/) of the various statistical tests, methods, terminologies, and other statistics-related topics applicable to the medical field. I've talked on research designs, internal consistency, sample size calculation, inferential statistics, assumption testing, and common statistical software including those that requires coding ([R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/)) and no-coding, and a demonstration of how statistical analysis is done in [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org/). Definitions of terms, data types, types of hypotheses, p-value, confidence interval, descriptive statistics, and parametric and nonparametric tests we also discussed.
