I'm a BS Applied Mathematics graduate turned into a **Health Data Scientist and Bioinformatician**.

My research interests are in turning messy high-dimensionality biological data into human interpretable information.

To that end, I'm currently optimizing an R package designed to streamline metabolomics workflows - from data preprocessing to downstream statistical analysis.

Last May to June 2025, I was **Honorary Visiting Research Associate** at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), United Kingdom. I was one of the seven all-Asian early career researchers who attended the **Workshop: Computational Statistics and Data Science for Linguistics** ([Jean Golding Institute's blog post here](https://jeangoldinginstitute.blogs.bristol.ac.uk/2025/07/29/how-to-make-data-science-skills-stick-learnings-from-the-ocsean-project/)). There, we've used **Python** to analyze linguistics data to ultimately link language, genetics, and heritage. This was made possible via **[Oceanic and Southeast Asian Navigators (OCSEAN)](www.ocsean.eu)** project, which is funded by the European Commission with a H2020-MSCA-RISE-2019 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Research and Innovation Staff Exchange grant, Project Number 873207. It is a consortium of 25 institutions from all continents to bring light to the astonishing Austronesian movement, including [University of Tartu](https://ut.ee/en), [UPPSALA University](https://www.uu.se/en), [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), [Davao Medical School Foundation, Inc.](https://www.dmsf.edu.ph/), and 21 others. Our output has been made public in my [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jllcalorio/ocsean-data-science-workshop-2025).
