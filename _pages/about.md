I'm a BS Applied Mathematics graduate turned into a **Health Data Scientist and Bioinformatician**.

My research interests are in turning high-dimensionality biological data into human interpretable information.

To that end, I'm currently optimizing an R package designed to streamline metabolomics workflows - from data preprocessing to downstream statistical analysis.

Last May to June 2025, I was an **Honorary Visiting Research Associate** at the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/), United Kingdom. I was one of the seven all-Asian early career researchers who attended the **Workshop: Computational Statistics and Data Science for Linguistics**. There, we've used **Python** to analyze linguistics data to ultimately link language, genetics, and heritage. This was made possible via **[OCSEAN](www.ocsean.eu)** is funded by the European Commission with a H2020-MSCA-RISE-2019 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Research and Innovation Staff Exchange grant, Project Number 873207.
